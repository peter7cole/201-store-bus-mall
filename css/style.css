/* 

Plan here is to make a clean, grey and orange and blue
themed set up with a clean sans-serif font, and nice thin box borders
around everything, good padding and spacing, centered on the screen,
slim layout so that anyone on a mobile could access it easily.
Need to look up how to access classes without IDs again,
but I have the CSS Diner tutorial for that.
